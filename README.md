# Rust_Challenges
Tracking everything i code in RUST inside this Repository. Initialising from the beginning so experts has no entry in here : D 

<h2>a_variables</h1>
This Directory consist of a main.rs which is created in order to Practice Variable formats. Since variables in Rust are immutable by default and it is strongly typed language. We need to Define mut, datatype and so on.

<h2>b_functions</h1>
This directory consist of a main.rs which is created in order to Practice different sort of rules and how we define and use function. 
#Things i have learned.
<ul>
  <li>We define function with keyword fn </li>
  <li>Datatype should be present inorder to use it as Argument</li>
  <li>If there is some sort of returning value inside scope then it needs to be defined ( -> DataType )</li>
<ul>
