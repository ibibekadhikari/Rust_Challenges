# Rust_Challenges
Tracking everything i code in RUST inside this Repository. Initialising from the beginning so experts has no entry in here : D 

<h2>a_variables</h1>
This Directory consist of a main.rs which is created in order to Practice Variable formats. Since variables in Rust are immutable by default and it is strongly typed language. 
<em>Things to know: </em>
<ul>
 <li>let or const keywords are used inorder to declare variables.</li>
  <li>Variables are immutable by default so, <code>mut</code> keyword can be used to make it mutable.</li>
  <li>const needs to be declared in a <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code> while normal variables & functions can be declared with <code>snake_case</code>.  </li>
  <li>Datatype should be defined after the variable name and colon. Example <code>let intvalue : i32 </code> for integer and f64 for float.</li>
</ul>

<h2>b_functions</h1>
This directory consist of a main.rs which is created in order to Practice different sort of rules and how we define and use function. 
<em>Things to know: </em>
<ul>
  <li>We define function with keyword fn </li>
  <li>Datatype should be present inorder to use it as Argument</li>
  <li>If there is some sort of returning value inside scope then it needs to be defined ( -> DataType )</li>
<ul>
